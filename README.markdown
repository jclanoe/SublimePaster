# Sublime Paster

A Sublime Text 2 plugin to provide Post/Fetch support for multiple pastebins, including Lodgeit, dpaste.com and pastie.org


# Install & Config

    $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    $ git clone git://github.com/robcowie/SublimePaster.git

Add config to User file settings. Only required key is `mode`.

    "pastebin": {
        "mode": "dpaste",
        "copy_to_clipboard": true
    }

If the pastebin implementation needs further config, such as user credentials add it here, i.e.

    "pastebin": {
        "mode"       : "dpaste",
        "username"   : "Tim the Enchanter",
        "password"   : "antioch",
        "user_token" : "e4023a6b-a9fc-40d8-bdfb-357ea7bb60cb"
    }

A good example for using Pastie is:

    "pastebin": {
        "mode": "pastie",
        "username" : "Tim the Enchanter",
        "copy_to_clipboard": true,
        "prompt_on_post" : false,
        "private": true,
    }

# Usage

Default key bindings are shift+ctrl+p to post and shift+ctrl+f to fetch
